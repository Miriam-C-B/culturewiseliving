                <p>
                    In my last post <a href="misunderstandings-uni" target="_blank">Misunderstandings: At Uni</a> I explained how knowing the structure tutors 
                    use for their feedback can help you understand it better. In this post, I will take a closer look at structure in English writing.
                </p>

                <h2>What is structure?</h2>
                <p>
                    When you talk about language, structure is another word for the order in which you have to say or write words, sentences, paragraphs 
                    and even chapters. You already know one of the most basic structures in English and use it regularly: sentence structure. If you want 
                    to be understood, you have to say and write words in the right order. sense make Mixed no words up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Do you see what I mean? Did the last sentence in the previous paragraph annoy you? Am I on the brink of losing you as a reader? Or 
                    did you take the time to figure out its meaning? If so, how long did it take you? “Mixed up words make no sense.”
                </p>  

                <p>
                    Using the right sentence structure is important if you want people to understand you. The better your English is, the less you have 
                    to think about sentence structure. It is a blueprint you use automatically and one you share with your listeners. But it is not the 
                    only kind of structure you need to know to communicate successfully. Let’s look at the next level up.
                </p>    

                <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
                <p>
                    You might have already noticed that English non-fiction writers use a lot of paragraphs. It does not matter if we are talking about 
                    academic papers or theses, journalistic articles or popular non-fiction books. They all divide up their writing in chunks, that might 
                    be a lot smaller than what you are used to from your own language. They certainly break up their writings into more pieces than Germans 
                    and French people do. By doing so, writers create white space on the page, that signals to English readers that your article/paper/book 
                    will be easy and pleasant to read. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, using a lot of paragraphs is not just an aesthetic choice. Splitting up your writing is also a way to structure your content. 
                    In English writing each paragraph contains one idea. For example, the topic of the paragraph above is “English non-fiction uses a lot 
                    of paragraphs”. The topic of each paragraph is summed up in the topic sentence which has to appear either at the beginning of your 
                    paragraph (as in the example above) or at the end. At least, that is the official rule but in my personal experience English native 
                    speakers prefer writing that has the topic sentence at the beginning of a paragraph.
                </p>

                <h2>Essay/article/coursework/thesis</h2>
                <p>
                    Putting the most essential information at the beginning is such an important rule, that it also applies to the larger structure of your 
                    text. This means that every essay, article, coursework, or thesis begins with a paragraph or introduction that has to include your 
                    conclusion, meaning the main point of your writing. So you have to mention your main argument, your opinion, your thesis etc. in your 
                    introduction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After your first paragraph/introduction you keep applying the same principle: begin with your most important argument and work your way 
                    down. If you want to make three distinct points, for example, you have to start with your most convincing one, then work your way down the list.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on where you come from, this might feel strange. Won’t you spoil the fun, if you tell your readers right at the beginning what 
                    you’re writing towards? Won’t it make your writing terribly boring? Not for English native speakers. Quite the opposite. If you want your 
                    readers to understand you quickly and easily, you need to use the structure they are familiar with.
                </p>

                <h2>How important is structure really?</h2>
                <p>
                    Remember the mixed-up sentence in the first part of this post? How did feel when you first read it? You probably understood the meaning, 
                    especially if you bothered reading it twice. But what if I had written an entire paragraph with jumbled up words? Or changed the order 
                    of the sentences or even paragraphs in this post? Would you have bothered figuring out what I was trying to say? I know I wouldn’t. 
                    When we read something – anything – we expect the author to make reading easy for us by presenting their ideas in a way we understand quickly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is also the very real danger that people might completely miss your point. Time for an example. Before I could teach undergraduate 
                    students, I had to take a teacher training course. We had assignments every week, and one of them was to watch a recorded lecture by a 
                    non-native speaker. The lecture was divided into three parts. The first part was an introduction to the topic, but the speaker did not 
                    mention his main point. He revealed this in the second part and spent the third part of his lecture to explain and give examples.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was a bit early for the next class and while we waited for our teachers, I overheard two of my fellow future tutors discuss the 
                    lecture. They both complained that the lecturer did not make a point. They were native speaker Brits in the middle of their PhDs. 
                    Because the lecturer made his main point in the second part instead of the first or at the very least last part of his lecture, using 
                    a structure that is simply not used by English native speakers, my classmates completely missed the point. Worse, they thought the 
                    lecturer had not made a point at all.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This example is extreme, but by no means an exception. I have friends who were told in feedback that their arguments were unconvincing. 
                    I cannot tell you how many times a tutor told me to mention a certain fact/author/quote I had included in the text, just not at the 
                    precise moment they expected to read it. In all these cases the problem was not the content but the order in which it was presented.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You might be tempted to be annoyed about this, but if you look at it from another point of view, this is fantastic news! Knowing 
                    about structure means that you can instantly improve your writing simply by changing the order. Put your main arguments into the 
                    right spot and your essays, papers and theses will be more convincing. It also applies to lectures and even presentations in school 
                    or at work.
                </p>

                <h2>What can you do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn the right structure. Whenever you have to write something or give a speech in front of people, make sure you learn the structure 
                    first. Read and watch what native English speakers do. Then analyse their writings or speeches. The following questions are a good starting point:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How many sections does the speech/writing have?</li>
                    <li>How long is the introduction?</li>
                    <li>How long is the main part? Is it sub-divided into separate arguments?</li>
                    <li>What is the main point and when is it mentioned?</li>
                    <li>When do they give examples? How many? How much time do they spend on explaining?</li>
                    <li>Do they repeat themselves? If yes, which information do they repeat? How often and at which points?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If you have to give presentations, watch native speakers who are successful in your field. If you have to write an essay, make sure 
                    you learn English essay structure, especially if you prepare for an IELTS or TOEFL test. There are a lot of brilliant blogs and information 
                    pages that will teach you all you need to know to get high scores in a language test. Just google “English essay structure”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you’re writing coursework, a term paper or a thesis (bachelor, master or PhD), make sure you analyse papers written by native 
                    speakers. Ask your advisors or tutors for recommendations, then use the questions above to study the structure. Note anything else 
                    you notice about the order in which they present their ideas. Analyse speeches, presentations and writings on every level. Scrutinize 
                    the overall structure as well as the order of paragraphs and sentences.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next time you get feedback that seems unfair or makes no sense, get bad grades on an assignment or a low score on your writing 
                    for the IELTS/TOEFL, check your structure and fix it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    You've got this!
