                <p>
                    Have you ever been hit by words, you never even suspected you might need to know, like “spatula”, “cable binders”, or “deposit”? 
                    Has this ever happened to you in a situation where you could not look the words up? In this post I share questions you can ask 
                    when you need to figure out fast what someone is talking about. Languages consist of so many words that no matter how much you’ve 
                    learned in school or at University there is still a good chance that you will be stumped by new vocabulary once you move to a country.
                </p>

                <h2>At a service station in the Australian outback</h2>
                <p>
                    Customer: ‘Hi. Do you sell spark plugs?’
                    <br>Me: ‘What’s that?’
                    <br>Customer: ‘You know, spark plugs. [Louder and slower:] SPARK PLUGS.’
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had a lot of conversations like this while I worked at a service station in the Australian outback. You see, the service station was 
                    on a busy road pretty much smack in the middle between two towns, both two hours away from us. This meant that the service station was 
                    quite large and in addition to gas also sold food, drinks and a lot of tools, cleaning supplies and even small car parts.
                </p>   
                
                <p>
                    I don’t know about you, but I learned “hammer” in school and possibly “screwdriver”, but definitely not “wrench”, “pliers” or “spark plugs”. 
                    And it’s not merely a matter of a foreign language. With some appliances I had no idea what they were called in my native language either! 
                    So when customers asked me if we had [insert strange new word here] I sometimes had no idea what they were talking about. At first, I asked 
                    the question above: “What is that?” It took me two days to realise that this question was not working at all because people are not used to 
                    define words. Unless you are a teacher, you simply don’t have to explain to others what a word means. Since customers would get impatient and 
                    even angry rather quickly though, I had to figure out a different way to communicate.
                </p>

                <h2>"What do you use it for?"</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my favourite question. If I asked a customer “What do you use it for?” they were always able to answer my question, because unlike 
                    defining a thing, telling someone what you need it for is a lot easier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If someone answered “To clean my windshield”, this might already be enough information for me to help them. The products in the service station 
                    were sorted by categories. Windshield wipers would be with the windshield washer fluid, and other cleaning products and spare parts for your 
                    windshield. So if the customer mentioned “windshield”, I would simply take them to the particular section in the store that dealt with products 
                    related to windshields. If this did not work, I might take them to the second hint in their answer: cleaning products and tools. Nine times out of 
                    ten, the customer would spot the product on the shelf, without me actually having to look for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This question also works very well for kitchen utensils and other objects in the household should your housemate ask you to hand over the “spatula”. 
                    “What do you use it for?” To stir the vegetables in the pan. And suddenly you have a very good idea about what a spatula is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best part: it works the other way around too. Say you are the customer, and you don’t know a certain word. You can simply tell the salesperson what 
                    you need the thing for so they can take you to the correct section in the store.
                </p>

                <h2>"What does it look like?"</h2>
                <p>
                    If the first question does not work, either because the customer might not be able to explain to you what they were going to do with the product or 
                    because their explanation is riddled with more unknown vocabulary, you can simply ask them to describe it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When they do, make sure they answer the following questions: What colour is it? How big is it? What shape is it? And what material is it made from?
                </p>

                <p>
                    When it comes to the size and the shape, the customer might even use gestures to paint an image of the object into the air for you. Chances are good, 
                    that you will have noticed the item and recognise it when you hear the description.
                </p>

                <h2>Won't people get angry if I quiz them?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are worried that customers might get angry if you don’t know a word, I can reassure you that in my experience if you genuinely try to
                     help them and ask politely, they won’t mind. You will get the odd look because the person might never have had to describe what pliers looked 
                     like before, but a strange look is usually the worst that will happen. Yes, some people will be rude and might even insult you, but there are 
                     customers like that in every country. Remember they leave eventually, and there is a good chance that the next customer will be nicer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope this post will help you communicate better with people even if they use words you haven’t learned yet. The examples and questions in this 
                    post are useful when you talk about actual objects and products, especially if they are somewhere around so you can take a look at them. But what 
                    if it’s not just a vocabulary question? What if you talk to your boss or your teacher or your academic advisor and you don’t understand what they 
                    are talking about? Check out next month’s post to find out what you can do in those situations.
