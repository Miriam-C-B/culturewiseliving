      <h2>What is culture shock?</h2>
      <p>
        Culture shock is a condition that you will very probably go through (or might have already gone through) when you live abroad. The term is 
        misleading because “shock” implies that it happens suddenly and won’t last long. Neither is true. In my experience culture shock comes on 
        so gradually that many people don’t even realise they have it and it lasts for several months. If you want more detailed information, the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia article</a> on the subject is excellent.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        When you move to a new country chances are that at first, everything is great! You love the food/ the people/ the language/ the music… you 
        love everything! After a while though, usually 3-6 months into your new life, you start being less happy about the differences and you 
        develop strange symptoms.
      </p>  

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Why do people have to be so rude? Why does this not work out? Why would they act like that? What is wrong with them? 
      </p>    

      <p>
        People react very differently to culture shock so the symptoms are varied. Because they can be so different you might not even realise that you 
        have culture shock. If you find yourself asking the questions above over and over again, though, unable to stop, you should take a closer look at 
        how you are feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been through three culture shocks in my life so far and it felt different each time. The first time, I was mainly angry and could not stop 
        going through the catalogue of questions above. The second time, I was still angry but also very sad. I developed depression, meaning I had difficulties 
        getting out of bed and would get more upset about problems than was normal for me. The third time, I was mainly depressed with a pinch of anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other symptoms include feeling exhausted and listless though you are physically healthy and have not overstrained yourself. Breaking out in tears is 
        also fairly common, as are anxiety, anger and even temper tantrums.
      </p>

      <h2>What you shouldn't do</h2>
      <p>
        Do not suppress your feelings. Accept them. They are your mind’s way of coping with what is an incredibly stressful situation. The reason why we have 
        cultural norms is so we can go through life without thinking and worrying too much. When people mostly behave as we expect them to behave, it makes our 
        lives easer and less stressful. When you move to a different culture this security is taken away from you, which is incredibly stressful. Your body reacts 
        by having feelings about this. Do not suppress them. Accept them. Sit with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        You might want to talk to your family and friends back home about it. Don’t do this. They do not understand. What is even worse, they will tell you that 
        you should be grateful because you get to live abroad. They might even get impatient and tell you to stop complaining. Talking to them will make you feel 
        guilty and make matters worse. I am not trying to be nasty and I am sure your family and friends are amazing but unless they have actually been through a 
        culture shock themselves, they will not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me give you an example. I eat a lot of bread. I am a vegetarian and bread and rolls make up about half of my diet. Bread is different in different countries. 
        What they sell as bread in the UK, for example, has entirely different words for in French and German because it would not be considered bread. When I lived in 
        the UK I missed “normal” bread so much, that some days I felt like sitting down on the floor and crying. That is how much the English bread depressed me 
        because it was different.
      </p>

      <p>
        If someone has never felt that kind of sadness, loss and longing for something familiar before, they will not understand. So do not talk to the people 
        back home because there is a very good chance they will make you feel worse.
