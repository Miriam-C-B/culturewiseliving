    <h1>Culture Shock - What Now?</h1>

      <h2>Your feelings are normal</h2>
      <p>
        You are not alone. Your feelings are valid and important. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people who live abroad will eventually go through a culture shock. This is normal. Culture is the frame through which we see the world. 
        When you constantly have to deal with surprises, unexpected behaviour and outcomes, it is exhausting and anxiety, sadness and anger are normal human 
        reactions. Some people have stronger reactions than others. For some the symptoms are so mild that they might not even notice that they have culture 
        shock. And in case you were wondering, even though I went through three different culture shocks and the symptoms changed slightly, it did not get 
        easier. But knowing what I had, that it was normal and that others were going through it as well, made coping a lot easier.
      </p>  

      <h2>Take one day at a time and be kind to yourself</h2>
      <p>
        Understand that you are under constant stress. This is stress on top of any other stress you might have at work or at school/University. So be kind 
        to yourself and take extra care of yourself. Make sure you eat enough, rest enough and exercise enough (walking is exercise!).
      </p>    

      <h2>Talk about it</h2>
      <p>
        I once sat on my bunkbed in a hostel in Australia when my roomie came in, threw herself on her bed and cried. I asked her what the matter was, 
        and she told me that she felt incredibly sad all the time. It was so bad that she would burst into tears without reason and was unable to stop crying. 
        She had been on the phone with her family back home and they kept telling her that she should not complain. Instead, she should be grateful and happy 
        because she got to be in Australia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So I told her about culture shock. By the end of the conversation she was no longer crying because knowing what is going on and understanding that 
        you are not alone already helped calm her down.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, talk to someone who has been or is going through it. Talk to people who have lived for a considerable amount of time (at least six months) 
        in a different culture. Show them this article or the Wikipedia article about culture shock and talk about how you feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Find a friend you can share your experiences with, someone who is also a foreigner so you can bond by complaining about the country you live in. I know 
        this may sound mean, but it is actually a very good way of venting your frustrations and grievances about your new home. It also saves you from accidentally 
        complaining to locals which would be mean and very rude. Don’t be afraid to reach out and make new friends! Chances are that others will be just as glad 
        to have someone to talk to as you are.
      </p>

      <h2>Embrace the differnces</h2>
      <p>
        English bread made me sad. English pizza was even worse. They put Cheddar cheese on pizza and don’t even get me started on their four cheese version.
      </p>

      <p>
        I mentioned before that bread is normally a very big part of my diet, but because the English versions made me so sad I looked for alternatives. 
        Pizza was out. But in the UK every supermarket sells affordable and delicious Indian ready meals and ingredients. I had only tried Indian food once 
        before so I gave it another go and I loved it. The other thing I ate far more than I used to were chips (thick fries) because they were everywhere and 
        delicious. It might sound silly or like a small matter to you that I changed my diet, but it made a huge difference to me because it reduced the time 
        I spent being sad by half. So take your feelings seriously because they tell you what is wrong, which brings me to the next point.
      </p>

      <h2>Figure out what's bothering you</h2>
      <p>
        You might think it should be obvious but because culture shock has such varied symptoms, you might not be aware what the actual problem is that is 
        causing your symptoms, or you might dismiss it as unimportant (like bread).
      </p>

      <p>
        Don’t do this to yourself. Your feelings are your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong, often what is wrong and what needs to be changed 
        if possible. So listen to yourself and if you can, make changes.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        If you cannot change what is bothering you, try changing your attitude.
      </p>

      <h2>If all else fails...</h2>
      <p>
        For some people visiting their home country can be a solution when their new life becomes unbearable. A different friend of mine, also in Australia, 
        got depressed because she missed her family and her boyfriend. She became so unwell that she could not stop crying for hours. Luckily for her, she 
        could afford to go back home for three weeks. This turned out to be what she needed and when she returned to Australia she was calm again.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you cannot afford to go home, and you simply cannot find anyone to talk to, seek professional help. Depression and anxiety are serious. Go see a 
        doctor, call a help line and find out what other kinds of help are available in the country you live in. Take it seriously, because it is.
      </p>
