                <p>
                    … do as Romans do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You might have heard the saying before. You might also know that it means “adapt to your surroundings and behave 
                    the same way the people around you do. Adopt the new culture, embrace the differences and do your best to fit in.” I 
                    have met people who firmly believe in this saying, who will offer it to others as sound advice and might 
                    even urge them to change their behaviour accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not one of those people. Sure, you need to adapt to a certain degree to function in a new country and a new culture. 
                    But within reason. In my experience, adapting completely is impossible and when people try, they suppress parts of themselves 
                    which often leads to or makes culture shock worse. For your own sake, understand that you need to draw a line.
                </p>

                <h2>You cannot adapt to everything</h2>
                <p>
                    People often think that the most difficult part about living abroad is to “put up with” other people’s unpredictable, strange and 
                    often “rude” behaviour. But after living in another country for a while, you’ll realise that this is easier than you might have 
                    expected. Sure, it’s annoying when people do not live up to your expectations, but it is a lot worse, when you suddenly have to 
                    be “rude” yourself if you want to be successful in your new home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are different levels of adaptation, and only you can decide where to draw the line. Time for a few examples.
                </p>   

                <h2>Easy change</h2>
                <p>
                    A Thai colleague taught me that it is rude to point with your foot, even if you have your hands full and you want to draw his 
                    attention to a parcel on the floor. Until he told me about this, I had not even realised that I used my foot to point at things. 
                    It took me a few tries, but I learned eventually to stop doing that because it was easy and made no difference to me but a big 
                    difference to him. In this case, I adapted fully to his preferences.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenging change</h2>
                <p>
                    A more challenging custom was the typical British greeting:
                        <div class="indented-text">
                            “Hi, how are you?”
                            <br>“Fine, thanks. How are you?”
                            <br>“Fine, thanks for asking.”
                        </div>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why is this a challenge? It’s only polite, a British person will tell you but here’s the thing, it’s incredibly rude for Germans 
                    and Taiwanese people. In both German and Taiwanese culture honesty has a very high value and a very narrow definition. If someone 
                    asks a question they don’t want an honest answer to, they are being dishonest because they are faking interest. Worse still, if
                     you are expected to answer “fine” no matter how you actually feel, you are expected to tell a lie.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now for British people (also US Americans and Australians) this entire exchange is not a conversation, but merely an elaborate 
                    form of “Hello”. The sentences are neither real questions, nor real answers. Going through the exchange is just a polite greeting 
                    and nothing more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So what is clashing here is two versions of politeness: for British people the greeting is necessary to start a polite conversation. 
                    For Germans and Taiwanese lying to each other from the start ruins potentially good relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To me, this turned into an intermediate problem. I realised I had to find a way to go through the typical greeting without getting 
                    angry or I would send the completely wrong signal to people I just met. So I changed my attitude by telling myself that all I was 
                    saying was a very wordy version of “Hello”. If you feel whimsical, you can even imagine you are a spy and these are the code 
                    phrases you need to exchange with your fellow spy before you can talk freely, code phrases that identify both of you as polite individuals.
                </p>

                <h2>Drawing the line</h2>
                <p>
                    A custom I could not adapt to was “gossiping”. Two of my friends used to talk about other people in their absence. So far so ok, 
                    because we all do that. But the conversations would often turn negative. I am very direct and have this personal rule that I 
                    don’t say anything behind someone’s back I would not say to their face (if they bothered to ask for my opinion) and as a result 
                    I ended up getting very mad twice at my two friends. They told me that what they thought they were doing was gossiping. To me it was bitching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I could have simply adopted their definition of gossiping or changed my attitude to their behaviour. I could have just listened 
                    without participating. I knew them both very well and I knew they did not think what they were doing was in any way bad. It was 
                    merely their way of talking about other people. But I chose not to. Instead, I explained to them that if they wanted to have 
                    these kinds of conversations, they would have to have them without me, which is what they ended up doing.
                </p>

                <h2>Adapt sensibly</h2>
                <p>
                    You can adopt other people’s definitions of politeness, you can change your attitude and you can adapt but you are the only one 
                    who can judge how much adapting will cost you, how much work it will mean and whether it is worth it to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So when in Rome… … watch carefully what the Romans do and adapt to the kinds of behaviours you are ok with. You’re 
                    not a Roman, you will never be a Roman, and that’s fine. It’s ok to draw a line.
                </p>
