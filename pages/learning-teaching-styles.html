                <p>
                    I know what it’s like to be a student and a teacher on a graduate and postgraduate level. In this post I want to share my 
                    experience studying and teaching in a different culture to show you that approaches and styles to learning can vary a lot.
                </p>

                <h2>Learning is culturally specific</h2>
                <p>
                    I realised this even before I moved to the UK, when I was still living in Australia. A good friend of mine from Taiwan 
                    tried to teach me Taiwanese. In exchange, I tried to teach her basic Italian. It did not go well at first because our 
                    teaching and learning styles were very different.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    I realised that in Germany we tend to learn the building blocks of a language and then the rules for putting those blocks 
                    together. This means that we memorise long lists of vocabulary and word groups. On top of that we study grammar. And then 
                    we practice sentences. A little bit.
                </p>  

                <p>
                    Because this is how I was used to learn (and how I am still learning) that was how I tried to teach my friend. I started 
                    with basic vocabulary, the most (grammatically) important verbs and sentence structure. Learning the theory first, then 
                    applying it, is called the deductive approach, by the way.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    My friend was soon frustrated with me. She kept asking me for example sentences and I was unwilling to give her those because 
                    they were full of words and grammar, I had not taught her yet. How was she ever supposed to understand?
                </p>

                <p>
                    When it was her turn to teach me, I eventually realised that we simply had different approaches to learning. She gave me entire 
                    sentences in Taiwanese and used those to explain vocabulary and grammar. This in turn frustrated me because I wanted to learn 
                    the building blocks first. Once I realised that she simply used an inductive learning style (you begin with actual examples and 
                    figure out patterns and meanings from them), our lessons became a lot more relaxed.
                </p>

                <h2>Types of learners</h2>
                <p>
                    The way you study is shaped by whether your teachers used inductive or deductive teaching styles in school. But there is also a personal 
                    side to learning. You might have heard of the four different types of learners before. Here’s a quick reminder:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Visual learners learn best from images, infographics, posters, etc.</li>
                    <li>Auditory learners can retain information they hear best, so their ideal form of learning is through lectures.</li>
                    <li>Reading/writing: Learners remember information best if they have read it and often also written it down. Taking notes 
                        is a good way to learn for them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Kinaesthetic learners learn best when they are moving around. A good way to learn is to repeat information while you walk around 
                        your room or take regular breaks for exercise.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Bear in mind that your teachers are people too and have their own learning styles. We tend to assume that everybody else is like us 
                    so if a teacher favours a particular style, they might not just be better at it but might using it when they teach. That is why some 
                    teachers mainly lecture, while others give you lengthy handouts, use lots of pictures or take breaks to allow you to move around.
                </p>

                <h2>What does this mean for your studies?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have problems understanding your teachers or the material you are supposed to learn, it might be because they are using a 
                    different learning style from the one you are used to. In the humanities in Germany, for example, getting a lot of preparatory 
                    reading is common practice. Your tutors will expect that you have understood most if not all of the reading by yourself, so that 
                    the focus in the seminar can be on discussions. I contrast, at English Universities letting students figure out problems in groups 
                    and thus learning by doing is a more common way of teaching. Theories are often not discussed in detail but instead applied in tasks. 
                    These styles might be scary or difficult for you if you are used to lecture-based teaching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the UK there is an increasing awareness of different learning styles and teachers are encouraged to adapt their lessons to every kind 
                    of learner. If you have already had a few seminars and have been wondering why your teachers keep splitting you up into groups in a way 
                    that forces you to change your seat, it’s because they are trying to help out kinaesthetic learners who lose focus if they have to sit 
                    still for too long. It’s also why lecturers often have visuals in their presentations and why poster presentations are an increasingly 
                    popular learning tool and assignment. They help visual learners make sense of a topic.
                </p>

                <h2>How can you make your life easier?</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, take a few minutes and think about your own learning style. Chances are you already instinctively learn in the way that is 
                    easiest to you. Do you doodle on your notes to add images to your writing? Do you prefer to look at charts rather than read the information 
                    in the text? Then you might be a visual learner. Do you remember everything your lecturer said and have no problem focusing on audio books? 
                    Maybe you are an auditory learner. Or, are you like me, a reading/writing learner who has to write everything down or you’ll forget it almost 
                    immediately again? Do you have trouble focusing if you have to sit still for too long? Try taking your notes out for a stroll because you 
                    might be a kinaesthetic learner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lines between the different learning styles are not absolute. You might be great at one type of learning, ok at another and terrible at 
                    one or both of the other two. For example, I am a reading/writing learner and take a lot of notes. But I also remember images well. On the 
                    other hand, things I only hear (without visuals or taking notes), I forget almost immediately again. How you learn best, might also be 
                    different for different subjects. If you are not sure what works for you try out different methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next ask yourself how you are used to be taught. The easiest way is to think about school. Did your teachers start with the theory, the grammar, 
                    the building blocks of a topic and then taught you rules about how to put everything together or apply it? Then you are used to the deductive 
                    teaching style. Or did they start with examples and extracted the theory, the grammar, and the building blocks for those? That’s the inductive 
                    learning style.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bear in mind that just because your schoolteachers applied a particular style and you are used to this, it does not mean that it works best 
                    for you. If you had trouble learning in school this might be one of the reasons. Figuring out what you are used to is still step one, though. 
                    From there you can move on to step two: Zone in on what works best for you.
                </p>

                <h2>And then compensate</h2>
                <p>
                    If your teachers use a style that does not work for you, find the same information in a different format. Thanks to the internet this is possible 
                    for a lot of subjects. For instance, you have been given a text that explains a theory, like deconstruction, but you prefer the inductive learning 
                    style. See if you can find a text or a lecture in which someone deconstructs a poem, showing you with an example how deconstruction works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If your language teacher and the workbook you use in class keep giving you sentences but all you want is the basic vocabulary and the rules, 
                    find a different grammar book that focuses on what you need. Use it every time you feel lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might sound like a lot more work, but it’s worth it for several reasons. You’ll save yourself not just time but also a lot of frustration 
                    in the long run. Moreover, if we try to learn something but “fail” it makes us feel bad about ourselves, as if there was something wrong with 
                    us. That’s not a good feeling. Much better: assume that the teaching and learning styles do not suit you and try a different approach. Before 
                    you know it, “impossibly difficult” subjects might just click.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Happy learning!
