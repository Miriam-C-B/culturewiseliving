                <p>
                    Have you ever been in the situation that your boss gave you a task and you did it, but then they were not happy with 
                    the result? Instead, they told you, “That’s not what I meant!”, got annoyed or angry with you. I’ve been there. In this 
                    post I’ll give you some tips on how to avoid miscommunication at work.
                </p>

                <h2>"My boss just needs someone to blame."</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of you might not be convinced yet. You might think your boss is simply being unfair, blaming you for mistakes even 
                    though you did exactly what they told you to do. Or that it’s simply their fault for not giving proper instructions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is possible. Far more probable though is that the problem is miscommunication. Your boss is convinced they gave you 
                    the right instructions. You are convinced you’ve heard the right instructions. Yet, at the end of the day what you did was 
                    not what your boss wanted you to do. Why should you be the one to make sure there is no miscommunication? Because you get 
                    paid to do a good job, and to me that means it’s your responsibility to make sure you know what exactly your tasks are. If 
                    you double check you also save yourself A LOT of worry, time and maybe even money. So how can you avoid misunderstandings?
                </p>                

                <h2>Trial and error</h2>
                <p>
                    ‘Trial and Error’ is the easiest technique and I’m sure most of you are already using it. Another way to put it is: Learn 
                    from your mistakes. Whatever you want to call it, it works the same way. Your boss tells you to do something, you do what 
                    you think you’re supposed to do and see what happens. This technique has its advantages. It won’t take long for you to get 
                    feedback (especially negative feedback). It’s useful for simple tasks where the consequences are not so bad if you make a mistake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let me give you an example. When I worked in a cleaning team in a mining town in Western Australia my supervisor told me to check 
                    all the fire extinguishers and fill in a form for each one that was out of date. So I did. It turned out that they were almost all 
                    out of date and should have been checked by the fire department two months before. In total I filled in about thirty forms, at which 
                    point I was told by a very annoyed Health and Safety Manager that I could stop. The fire brigade would do a check on all of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The consequences of my “mistake” were negative but in a small way. I had wasted paper (although the forms had already been printed so…) 
                    and the Health and Safety guy was annoyed with me. Since I did not have to work with him directly, this did not matter to me. Trial and error.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But what about tasks that take weeks of work, maybe even months? Tasks, that you need to understand right from the start, so you won’t 
                    waste time and money?
                </p>

                <h2>"So, what you're saying is..."</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’ve read my general <a href="top-tips.html" target="_blank">Top Tips</a> for intercultural communication, you’ll already know that 
                    most problems are caused by misunderstandings because what you hear is not necessarily what someone else said. Misunderstandings are a part 
                    of living abroad. At work though, you have to try your best to avoid them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The easiest way to do that is by repeating what you hear back to your superior. Repeat what you think you should be doing. Let me give you another 
                    example. Picture a warehouse.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Boss: This parcel needs to arrive by tomorrow.
                    <br>What I hear: This parcel has to absolutely 100% arrive by tomorrow if it is at all humanly possible, 
                        even if it means we pay higher delivery costs.
                    <br>What I say: Should I send it with overnight delivery? (The only delivery option that guarantees that a 
                        parcel will arrive the next day, but it’s very expensive.)
                    <br>Boss: No, just send it first class recorded. (The chance that it will arrive the next day is about 80%, but it’s a lot cheaper.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    You see, if I had done what I thought I should do, I would have made a mistake. In the example the mistake would have cost my boss 
                    a few pounds and he would probably have been annoyed. He would have forgiven me, but in a job where you have a lot more responsibility, 
                    you can easily save your company money and yourself time and annoyance if you simply repeat instructions back to your boss, using your own words.
                </p>

                <h2>"But everyone will think I'm stupid!"</h2>
                <p>
                    If you worry that people will think you are slow, or that your English is bad or that you’re hard of hearing because you constantly repeat 
                    your boss’s instructions, I have to tell you that this is a danger. Some people tend to jump to conclusions, judge others far more harshly 
                    than they would want to be judged themselves and are not always kind.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Still, it’s worth weighing up the cost versus the gain. Ask yourself what the consequences are, if you do not double-check and make a mistake. 
                    How likely is it that your boss and colleagues will judge you? How happy will they be if you get it right? Also think long-term. 
                    In the long run, most employers notice and appreciate who’s doing a great job and makes the least mistakes. That’s what they really look for 
                    in an employee.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It did not take long for people to get used to me double-checking most tasks I was given. Some supervisors got annoyed, some clearly thought 
                    I was odd, but others did not seem to notice. ALL of them eventually got used to my questions and I have never been fired.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you’re not sure about how to repeat someone’s instructions back to them, try the technique out on a friend. It takes a bit of practice 
                    but in my experience, it is worth it. It makes your work life easier and more relaxed because you don’t have to worry so much about making mistakes.
                </p>
