                <p>
                    Everyone knows what a lie is. Right? So why this post? On a blog about culture no less? Don’t worry, I am not going to dabble in philosophy 
                    here, asking questions such as “What is the truth?” Instead, I will tell you a few things about truth and lies that I learned while living 
                    in different cultures. Let’s get started!
                </p>

                <h2>The truth</h2>
                <p>
                    What is the truth? Just kidding. Generally speaking, truth is what people consider to be facts. Now anyone who has ever been in an argument 
                    (no matter with whom or about what) already knows that facts are a matter of interpretation. As a result, truth is highly subjective. But 
                    as with all other things that are essentially highly subjective, as soon as enough people live together, they have to come to some sort of 
                    understanding about the definition of words and acceptable behaviours and how they are used in everyday interactions. Definitions become 
                    facts. “Everybody knows that…” is a common sentence about the “truth”.   
                </p>

                <h2>Defining a lie</h2>
                <p>
                    Like truth, you might think you know exactly what a lie is. The absence of truth. Or is it the opposite? Is that the same or not? What do you 
                    think? And why do you think that? Because that’s what your parents taught you and what the people around you believe and act on. Let’s explore 
                    this in more detail by looking at different subcategories of lies.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>White lie: A lie about a small and unimportant matter, usually told to avoid hurting someone’s feelings.</li>
                    <li>Lying by omission: Very similar to a half-truth but you deliberately leave out information you know is relevant.</li>
                    <li>You say something that is not true.</li>
                    <li>Liar: Someone who <span class="italic">knows</span> something is not true and says it anyway.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    OR
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Liar: someone who says something that is not true. Whether they know it’s not true or not <span class="italic">does not matter</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Do you agree with my definitions? Do you know more subcategories? What about politeness? In a <a href="when-rome.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> 
                    blog post a few months ago, I explained that British greetings can be offensive to people from some cultures because to them faking 
                    interest is a form of lie. For some of my British friends, polite comments are white lies, which are vital for human interaction. 
                    Others don’t even think of their greetings as lies because to them they are necessary phrases without any literal meaning any more. 
                    What do you think?
                </p>

                <h2>Truths, lies and values</h2>
                <p>
                    No matter how you define the word, “lie” has negative connotations. No one likes to be called a liar. But how lies are defined depends also on 
                    how much value people put on truth. In Germany, for example, people are convinced that lies never helped anyone and cause a lot of trouble, 
                    especially in the long-term. So white lies, half-truths and lies by omission are just as bad as full-blown lies. On the other hand, someone 
                    is only a liar if they tell a lie <span class="italic">on purpose</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In New Zealand you are a liar as soon as you say something that is not true. Whether you realise this or not does not matter. How do I know 
                    this? When I worked in Australia one of my bosses was a from New Zealand. She called me a liar once because I said something that was not true, 
                    only I had no idea this was the case.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This also brings me to an issue with the word “liar”. The job was ok, I liked my boss and I know she liked me. I had never even thought about 
                    quitting. The second she called me a liar, I resolved to quit the next day. Luckily, I managed to cool down and take a step back from the 
                    situation. Once I did that, I realised that my boss had smiled while she had called me a liar, clearly not meaning it as the unforgivable 
                    insult I heard. I also realised that she used “liar” in a different sense because she knew that I had not told an untruth deliberately. I 
                    did not quit and realised for the first time that “lie” and “liar” have culturally specific meanings and usages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also understood that calling me a liar is a very serious insult to me, so serious that I expect the other person to have proof 
                    (that would uphold in a court) before they utter such an accusation.
                </p>

                <h2>What does this mean for everyday life?</h2>
                <p>
                    When someone tells you… let’s call it an untruth, make sure you take a step back and look at the situation before you break off friendships, 
                    relationships, quit your job or start an argument. Check first if the person realises that they said something that is not true. If they did, 
                    are they lying to protect your feelings or cover their bottoms? What levels of politeness are required in the country you live in? Are you 
                    expected to lie? Do the natives lie to each other? Do you need to learn how to do that too?
                </p>

                <p>
                    How do you feel about being lied to? Have a look at my definitions of lies again. Which ones are you ok with, which ones do you not tolerate? 
                    How important is truth to you? How much do you lie on a daily basis? And before you say never, think again to make sure that’s the truth. 
                    As always being aware of your expectations will help you understand why you react in certain ways.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, never ever call anyone a liar. EVER. I cannot stress this enough. Even if you know your friend/colleague/boss/employee very well. 
                    It might be such a severe insult that you might ruin the relationship.
                </p>
