                <p>
                    We all love compliments. Who does not like to hear that their shirt, jacket or hat is lovely? 
                    Or that they did or said something funny or clever? Getting a genuine compliment might make you 
                    feel a bit embarrassed but also amazing and appreciated. Giving compliments is often step one on the road to 
                    friendship. What could possibly go wrong?
                </p>

                <h2>Paying a compliment</h2>
                <p>
                    In my <a href="top-tips.html" target="_blank">Top Tips</a> for intercultural communication I mentioned one very important fact: What you say is 
                    not necessarily the same as what the other person hears. Let’s start with an example. A few years ago, one of my fellow students 
                    wanted to pay me a compliment. She told me that I looked “so cute”. What she meant was that she liked my clothes, and possibly also that 
                    she wanted to be my friend. She was from Taiwan, and I knew that “cute” was definitely a compliment for her.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I am not from Taiwan. When someone uses the term “cute” for a woman I hear “you look nice”, but also “you look young and stupid”. 
                    The German translation of “cute” is “süss”, a word that also means “sweet”. To me, using it to describe an adult woman is at best condescending. 
                    Youth is another term that has different connotations in different cultures and languages. In my culture it’s not necessarily a positive term 
                    because youth goes hand in hand with inexperience. So what I heard was “you look nice, inexperienced and stupid”.
                </p>  

                <p>
                    Obviously, I knew she was trying to pay me a compliment. I also knew what the sentence meant to her, so I smiled and thanked her through gritted 
                    teeth. By then I was quite good at not letting my anger show. Why was I still angry at all? Because we automatically and physically react to what 
                    we hear, even if we know that it is not the same as what the person was trying to say. My body reacted to an insult with anger (racing heart, high 
                    blood pressure, lots of adrenaline… you know, getting ready for a fight). But because I knew what was happening, I could ignore the physical reaction.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    The morale from my little story is that when you give other people compliments, be aware that you might accidentally insult them. If someone else “insults” 
                    you but smiles brightly and has a track record of being nice to you, give them the benefit of the doubt. If you are not sure what they mean, you can always 
                    check: “Is that a compliment in your culture?” And before you know it, you’re off bonding about cultural differences.
                </p>

                <h2>Receiving a compliment</h2>
                <p>
                    In the previous example I accepted the compliment as graciously as I could. This was also not my natural reaction, which brings me to the second part of 
                    this post: receiving compliments. How people accept compliments is also culturally specific.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In many cultures, people are expected to be humble about their achievements and/or their looks, so if you compliment them on either, they might not 
                    actually thank you but instead smile embarrassed, change the topic, pretend they did not hear you, immediately pay you back with five compliments, 
                    or even start an argument to prove to you that you are quite mistaken, and they are not as great as you seem to think they are. This is perfectly 
                    normal so try not to get annoyed about it.
                </p>

                <h2>What about you?</h2>
                <p>
                    As always, it is important to start with getting to know yourself. How do you react to a compliment? What do you say and do? Did you recognise your 
                    own behaviour in the list above? If yes, you might want to ask yourself why you react that way. Is it cultural? Is personal insecurity? What would 
                    happen if you simply said “Thank you” with a genuine smile on your face? Would you worry that others judge you or would you worry that you judge yourself?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Knowing what you do and say and why will make it easier to change your behaviour if you have to, which leads us to the next step: How do other 
                    people in the culture you live in react? What are their expectations for “polite” reactions? In some countries modesty and denial of one’s 
                    achievements can actually make someone look arrogant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a lecture we both attended, my English housemate once asked me what I thought about the lecturer. A mutual Portuguese friend had told her 
                    that to her the man’s denials of his obvious achievements (he had been talking about them for an hour) sounded like false modesty. I had felt 
                    exactly the same about that lecturer and realised that because of his behaviour I had judged him and decided he was arrogant. To my English 
                    housemate, the man had sounded genuinely humble. So, depending on where you live, being too modest might actually be a bad idea. As always, 
                    you will need to find a balance between what is expected of you and what you are comfortable with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope I did not discourage you from paying people genuine compliments! They are important and everybody likes to hear what they do well. 
                    But I do hope that I have helped you see what might go wrong and how to deal with misunderstandings should they happen to you.
                </p>
