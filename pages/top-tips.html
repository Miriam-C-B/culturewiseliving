      <p>
        After a decade of experience with intercultural communication, here are my five general top tips that will hopefully make your life in another culture easier. 
      </p>

      <h2>1. What you hear might not be what you said</h2>
      <p>
        Has a friend ever been angry with you because they misunderstood something you said? A family member maybe? Have you ever been angry with someone who then 
        hastily explained that “that’s not what I meant”?
      </p>  

      <p>
        Misunderstandings happen with people we know well. They are even more common with strangers, and when you talk to people from cultures different 
        from your own, misunderstandings are inevitable.
      </p>    

      <p>
        So, if you notice that your new friend from another culture seems angry, offended or sad, check they heard what you wanted to say. 
        And if you find yourself getting angry, keep reading.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Assume a person’s polite until they're proven rude</h2>
      <p>
        Most people are not deliberately rude. If you meet someone who seems nice but every now and then says or does something terribly rude, assume 
        that they do not mean to offend you because what you hear/see might not be what they meant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is a small matter, a missed “please”, a withheld smile, or a too long stare, for example, try to overlook it. Get to know the person better 
        to find out if their “rudeness” is merely a cultural difference. Germans, for example, do not automatically smile at each other. And Italians 
        look at people for so long that if you are not used to it you might wonder why they are staring at you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the matter is not a small one, if it grates on you and threatens to drive you crazy, you can either avoid the person or say something. 
        But remember, assume that your new friend is not trying to be rude so bring the matter up gently.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Question all your assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="culture.html" target="_blank">Culture</a> is a word for codes and assumptions we use to make sense of our world. It is the frame through which we 
        look at (and judge) life and other people. Culture shapes our own behaviour and our expectations of other people’s behaviour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be aware that these are only your assumptions. Other people have beliefs and expectations that might be completely different. So when you 
        are frustrated and angry with the people around you, understand that you might currently disappoint and annoy them too.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Be kind</h2>
      <p>
        This is my favourite tip and applies to anyone, even if you do not live abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be kind to the people you meet because you don’t know what their day has been like or what they might be struggling with. If they are rude 
        to you, angry or upset, try not to take it personally and remember, what you heard might not be what they meant.
      </p>

      <p>
        An angry outburst could really mean “I am tired and frustrated with life today.” A missing smile might be the result of a sleepless night 
        or a generally serious resting face. And a rude reply might be caused by hunger. So be kind to others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as important: be kind to yourself. Living in a different country is stressful. Having to question your assumptions and deal with unexpected 
        problems on a daily basis is exhausting. Be patient with yourself when you don’t get things right, when it is you, who does not smile or snaps 
        at people. Eat well, exercise and take care of yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Not everything is about culture</h2>
      <p>
        Once you get into the habit of analysing people’s behaviour – yes, you do this even if you might not consciously notice it, because your brain 
        is always trying to understand others so it can adapt – you might go overboard and assume that everything is culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not the case. We are all individuals. Some of us are ruder and more selfish than others and there are people who will try to exploit 
        your kindness in every country. Figure out who is what and avoid these people as much as you can as a kindness to yourself.
