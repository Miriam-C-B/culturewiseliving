      <h2>What is culture?</h2>
      <p>
        Culture is everything you do and say, the way you do or say things, your expectations of yourself and other people. How you greet people, 
        how you eat your food, what you eat and even when you eat are also matters influenced by the culture you were raised in.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you hear sentences like “Americans do this…”, you are listening to generalisations based on what we think about somebody else’s culture. 
        These ideas are often also called prejudices and might be true or not. For example, English people drink lots of tea (mostly true) and eat hot 
        breakfast (mostly untrue), or Germans eat sausages (mostly true) and do not have a sense of humour (rarely true).
      </p>  

      <p>
        Right now, to give you another example, I am sitting in a chair in my home office, writing this post. I am wearing clothes. “Of course, you are!” 
        you might exclaim but the fact that I am wearing clothes in my own home is actually part of my culture. As a child I learned that wearing clothes 
        is important, so I wear them all the time without even thinking about it. It is a cultural norm. 
      </p>    

      <p>
        Cultural norms are automatic behaviours we do without thinking. More importantly, cultural norms are so automatic, that we think they are “natural” 
        and universal. They are neither. When we talk about “normal behaviour” we mean behaviour that conforms to our own cultural norms.
      </p>

      <h2>What is intercultural communication?</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as you communicate with someone from a different culture, either by speaking to them, exchanging e-mails, messages or tweets, or even by 
        sending non-verbal signals (yes, gestures are also a form of communication), you take part in an intercultural exchange.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often when we communicate with people from different countries they behave “strangely”, meaning in ways that are different from our own. 
        These situations can be very funny. My former Thai boss, for instance, once made a joke and we all laughed. Then she added, still laughing herself, 
        “Ah, I’m so funny” which made us all laugh even more.
      </p>

      <h2>The problem with culture</h2>
      <p>
        If intercultural communication goes well, it is interesting and fun because people from other countries surprise you with their differences. 
        But because cultural norms also influence small actions and words we use every day without even thinking about them, we tend to judge people when 
        they do not live up to our expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s have another look at my boss’s hilarious sentence. She was stating a fact. She is funny. For some people, however, her sentence might 
        have sounded like self-praise which is frowned upon in some cultures. As a result, she might have been misjudged as arrogant and rude. Because 
        she was talking to a multi-cultural team who liked her very much and agreed whole-heartedly with her self-assessment, the situation was funny. 
        But if she had been in a different setting, say in a job interview, making a joke to lighten the mood, she might have made a terrible impression 
        that could even cost her the job.
      </p>

      <p>
        Really? You might think now. Yes. Impressions are important, especially if you live in a culture that clashes with your own, meaning that is 
        very different from your own. And because culture is not just about the obvious things, like food and language, but about all the tiny details 
        and expectations you have without even realising that you have them, it is important to learn about culture and intercultural communication.
      </p>

      <h2>So, what can you do?</h2>
      <p>
        Learn about the culture you live in in whichever way is easiest and the most fun for you. You might just need to read up on the basics so you 
        can do your job or your studies. Find books or websites with specific tips for the country you live in, ideally before you move to it. If possible, 
        look for resources written by people with the same or similar cultural background you have.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are like me and are REALLY interested in understanding the people around you, watch and listen. Pay attention to people’s actions and behaviour. 
        What makes them happy? What makes them angry? What embarrasses them? What makes them turn away from a person they seemed to like? How do they behave and 
        how do they expect others to behave?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, if you are comfortable with your new friend/housemate/classmate/colleague or even boss, you might ask them questions but bear in mind that they 
        might get offended (because in some cultures direct questions are rude unless you know a person very well) or, more likely, they might not actually 
        be able to give you an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I once asked my English housemate what the right-of-way rule was for crossroads in small suburban streets in the UK. All she could tell me was that 
        there was no rule. When cars drove up to a crossroads, the drivers would somehow figure out who got to drive first, but my housemate could not actually 
        explain how she and other drivers did that. Was it a look, a gesture, were they mouthing words? She did not know because it was something that happened 
        automatically, something she did not do consciously.  
      </p>

      <p>
        So, watch others and yourself to learn as much as you can about the culture you live in and your own expectations and automatic behaviour.
