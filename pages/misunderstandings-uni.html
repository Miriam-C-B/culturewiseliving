                <p>
                    Towards the end of my MA at a University in the south of England I received an e-mail. All MA students were preparing 
                    their dissertations. To help us, the school organised a couple of days on which we had to present our topics to each other 
                    to get feedback. According to the e-mail, the event was mandatory. We all had to present AND attend all of the presentations. 
                    My friend from China, whose English was excellent, did not realise this. None of our mutual friends from China and Taiwan 
                    thought they had to come, much less present their topics. They thought it was optional and because it was more work, they 
                    did not do it. Teachers were furious, students were confused. I don’t know what exactly went wrong in this communication 
                    but meaning was certainly lost. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my opinion, a school that is in a large part funded by ridiculously high fees paid by its overseas students should hire 
                    trained and experienced communication experts to avoid such mistakes, but I doubt Universities in the UK will change any 
                    time soon. So instead, let’s see what you can do.
                </p>

                <h2>My English is excellent. I understood every word.</h2>
                <p>
                    Universities make you take a language test and only accept you if you reach a certain score. I can see why you would assume 
                    that since you have the right score, your English is good enough. Here’s the thing, though. Just because you understand every 
                    single word in a sentence you do not necessarily understand its meaning. Especially if you study in the UK. English people are 
                    very polite and as a result very indirect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let me give you an example. Which one of these sentences is a request?
                    <br>‘Could you please open the window?’
                    <br>‘It’s rather stuffy in here.’
                </p>   
                
                <p>
                    The first one? Yes. But so is the second. They both mean: ‘Open a window.’ Have you ever seen a picture of a table explaining 
                    what English people mean when they say certain things? Google “Anglo-EU Translation guide”. These tables are regularly shared 
                    on social media as a joke. They’re not. Feedback from your tutors will really sound like that. You might think you do a good job, 
                    your tutor is sure they’ve told you what you need to change and when you get your grades there’s a rude awakening.
                </p>

                <h2>The structure of feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    To understand feedback right, you first need to understand that it follows a very rigorous structure. Tutors from the UK and 
                    as far as I know also the US use the sandwich method:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>one or two positive comments/compliments</li>
                    <li>at least one thing the student needs to improve</li>
                    <li>one more compliment/encouragement</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Sounds good, right? Here’s what it looks like in real life though. I taught two undergraduate classes. No matter how terrible the 
                    work was, even if someone <span class="italic">completely missed the task</span>, I had to start with a positive remark. This was 
                    sometimes an exercise in creativity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second part of the feedback refers to mistakes the student made BUT I could not be direct. Instead of giving simple instructions, 
                    I had to write something that <span class="italic">sounded</span> positive: “While your graphics are excellent, you might want to improve 
                    readability.” This means: “If you don’t make your slides more readable, it will cost you at least ten points of your final grade.” Is 
                    that what you understood? If yes, good! If not, please read on.
                </p>

                <h2>"So, what you're saying is..."</h2>
                <p>
                    When you get feedback, either in writing or verbally, especially for work you will have to change and submit officially later, always make 
                    sure you know exactly what your tutor means. I encouraged all of my students to come to my office hour if they wanted to discuss the feedback. 
                    Almost no one did. You should. Tutors are there to help you improve your work. That’s literally their job.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also highly recommend that you go and see them in person. If you send e-mails, you just add to the list of possible misunderstandings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you are in a meeting, double check the feedback by telling your tutor what <span class="italic">you think</span> it means. I would 
                    advise that you do this even if you believe that you understood the feedback. It’s an absolute must-step if you misunderstood that tutor 
                    before or are not sure what you are supposed to do next.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let’s have a look at what such conversation would look like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You: In my feedback you wrote I should make my slides more readable. Would font size 30 be better?
                    <br>Tutor: The font you are using, is difficult to read in general. Try a different font and make sure that you can read the slides easily 
                        even if the presentation mode is off.
                    <br>You: But then all the information won’t fit onto the slides.
                    <br>Tutor: You can either spread it out on more slides – remember there is no limit on how many slides you use, just on the time 
                        it will take you to present them – or, better still, use bullet points instead of complete sentences.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see, talking it through helps you understand what you are supposed to do next. Your tutor might make even more suggestions, 
                    that are obvious to them but that you might not have thought of. So don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you would like to see another 
                    example for how you can double check meaning, have a look at my previous post on 
                    <a href="misunderstandings-work.html" target="_blank">Misunderstandings: At Work</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>What if my tutor thinks I'm stupid?</h2>
                <p>
                    Who cares? If you’re in an English speaking country, chances are you paid A LOT for your degree. It’s a teacher’s job to help you do the 
                    best work you can. So if they get impatient, annoyed, or you’re worried they will think less of you, power through. At the end of the year 
                    (or years) you will go home with a certificate and impatient tutors will soon be forgotten.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ve talked a little bit about the structure of feedback in this post. The <a href="importance-structure.html" target="_blank">next post</a> 
                    goes into more detail.
